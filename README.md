# Image-Pixel-Sorter-Animation
A Java program which sorts the pixels of an image and visually represents the changes through an animated display.

This program is a great example for both selection sort and its possible usage on GUI. It takes an image and starts to sort the pixels of it, it has a formulized method to calculate the brightness. 

User can see the process in detail with the help of the animation. If the chosen image is with high resolution, then program gets slower since the pixel amount rises. So, if you want to see the process faster, choose images with lower resolution.

In addition, program has the ability for user to use the program with multiple images. User can move between different images by using arrows from the keyboard. After passing to another image, program saves the progress so that when user came back to that image, program goes where it left.

I would love to see your comments, suggestions and upgrades for this project! Hope you like it.
